# The purpose of this script is to find all of the people who have committed changes to a specific
# file using CVSAnaly data. It takes a list of commits from a CVSAnaly database in a csv file
# where one field in the header file is "file_id". This is likely the output from one of the other
# scripts in this set: files_committed.sh or files_committed_withfilepath.sh. The output generated
# from either of those scripts can be used as input for this one.
# More details on CVSAnaly: http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY/
# Output is of the form: 
# file_id,commit_id,date,timezone,type,people_id,email

# WARNING: This can generate a massive amount of output for people who have edited a lot of files
# or frequently edited files.

# Note: this is NOT a general purpose script. I am using this with CVSAnaly and this script
#       is being used to generate specific output. I will only work in certain cases, and maybe only for me :)

# -i, --inputfile       FILE: Set the input filename (CSV file) where you want to do the search and replace
#                       This file should contain one email address per line.
#                       It should not contain a header row.
# -o, --outputfile      OUTFILE: Set the filename for the output file as OUTFILE where
#                       you want to store it. This file should not exist. If it does, original will be moved
#                       to /tmp and then overwritten.
# -d, --database        DATABASE: the database name to query.
# -u, --user-mysql      USER: the MySQL username.
# -p, --password-mysql  PASS: Not ideal, but you need to pass it a cleartext password.

# Read arguments from the command line and store them in variables
