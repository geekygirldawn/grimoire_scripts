# This script is used with mlstats databases find all of the messages within a certain year
# that a person has started or replied to. It then retrieves all of the messages within 
# each thread to find the other people who contributed to the same thread.
# thread subject, email address, date and message_id are stored in the final output file.
# A bunch of temporary, intermediate files are also written and are never cleaned up,
# since I use them for debugging, so you'll need to do some manual clean-up after a run.
# These temporary files can be found in the output directory.

# -e, --email		EMAIL: partial email string that can match multiple email address.
#			do select * from people with this string to confirm first. 
#			Use select * from people on partial name to look for other email addresses used.
# -d, --database	DATABASE: mlstats database where data can be found for this person
# -y, --year		YEAR: year that you want the data from
# -o, --output-dir	DIR: where the output and wip files will be stored. This directory must already exist.

# set default values for command line arguments

EMAIL=example
DATABASE=mlstats
YEAR=2014
