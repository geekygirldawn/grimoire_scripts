# The purpose of this script is to take a comma separated csv file with mlstats data of form:
# subject,email_address,first_date,message_id,database
# and add time zone data to output the following:
# subject,email_address,first_date,first_date_tz,message_id,database

# Note: this is NOT a general purpose script. I am using this with mlstats and this script
#       is being used to sanitize the output. I will only work in certain cases, and maybe only for me :)

# -i, --inputfile	FILE: Set the input filename (CSV file) where you want to do the search and replace
#			This file should be of the form (per line): thread subect,email,date,message_id
#			It should not contain a header row.
# -o, --outputfile	OUTFILE: Set the filename for the output file as OUTFILE where 
#			you want to store it. This file should not exist. If it does, original will be moved
#			to /tmp and then overwritten.
# -u, --user-mysql      USER: the MySQL username. 
# -p, --password-mysql  PASS: Not ideal, but you need to pass it a cleartext password.

# Read arguments from the command line and store them in variables
