# The purpose of this script is to make sure I have one email address per person
# so for people using multiple email addresses, replace one email address with a 
# single main email address.

# This script replaces previous shell script versions: de-dup-email.sh, de-dup-email-mac.sh

# Note: this is NOT a general purpose script. I am using this with mlstats/CVSAnaly and this script
#       is being used to sanitize the output. I will only work in certain cases, and maybe only for me :)

-h, --help
-i, --inputfile       FILE: Set the input filename (CSV file) where you want to do the search and replace
                      This file should be of a form (per line), similar to: thread subect,email,date,message_id
                      Most importantly, the file must be comma separated and contain email addresses.
                      CAUTION: if you have any other fields that contain email addresses, like mlstats message_id
                              This will clobber that field as well. You may need to tweak the sed command in this case.
-o, --outputfile      OUTFILE: Set the filename for the output file as OUTFILE where 
                      you want to store clean text. Note: sed also creates a .bak while editing this file
-e, --email-aliases   ALIASES: The file where the email aliases are stored. 
                      Each line should contain: old@example.com,new@example.com,# optional comment
