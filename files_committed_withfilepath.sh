# The purpose of this script is to take a list of email addresses (one per line) and find all
# of their commits (using a database generated by CVSAnaly - pre-requisite). In addition to finding
# their commits, it also displays each file changed in this commit with the type of change made.
# More details on CVSAnaly: http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY/
# Output is of the form:
# commit_id,date,timezone,file_id,file_path,file_name,type,people_id,email

# Caveats about file_path and file_name: Need to rely only on the file_id for analysis as filename 
# and file_path text can be misleading. In some cases, under a single commit, you see a file_id 
# listed with multiple file_paths or filenames. This occurs when a file has been renamed.
# CVSAnaly keeps all of the past filenames associated with a commit, which makes sense for some analysis

# Note: this is NOT a general purpose script. I am using this with CVSAnaly and this script
#       is being used to generate specific output. I will only work in certain cases, and maybe only for me :)

# -i, --inputfile	FILE: Set the input filename (CSV file) where you want to do the search and replace
#			This file should contain one email address per line.
#			It should not contain a header row.
# -o, --outputfile	OUTFILE: Set the filename for the output file as OUTFILE where 
#			you want to store it. This file should not exist. If it does, original will be moved
#			to /tmp and then overwritten.
# -d, --database	DATABASE: the database name to query.
# -u, --user-mysql      USER: the MySQL username. 
# -p, --password-mysql  PASS: Not ideal, but you need to pass it a cleartext password.

# Read arguments from the command line and store them in variables
